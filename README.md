Framework classes for building Omnis Studio XCOMPs

This is a framework I'm working on that combines a number of classes I've (re)written in various shapes and sizes as I've written Omnis Studio XComps over the years. I though it would be nice to donate these to the public domain. If you end up using any of this code feel free to drop me a line and a notice of sorts would be appreciated.

Current versions are all based on the Omnis Studio 4 non-unicode SDK though most will likely work on the Omnis Studio 5 SDK available at:
http://www.tigerlogic.com/tigerlogic/omnis/products/components/buildyourown.jsp

Unicode and Omnis Studio 5 support is UNTESTED.

Directories are setup relative and assume the framework is installed within the Omnis SDK folders:
Omnis SDK
 - complib
 - omnis.xcomp.framework
 - ...
