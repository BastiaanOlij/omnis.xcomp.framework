Framework classes for building Omnis Studio XCOMPs

This is a framework I'm working on that combines a number of classes I've (re)written in various shapes and sizes as I've written Omnis Studio XComps over the years. I though it would be nice to donate these to the public domain. If you end up using any of this code feel free to drop me a line and a notice of sorts would be appreciated.

Current versions are all based on the Omnis Studio 6 unicode SDK but for as long as it makes sense I will include Studio 4 non-unicode project files. In due course non-unicode support will not be guaranteed.
These project files can be found in the example library. In due time I plan to compile the main framework into a library that can be linked into any projects that need it.

More information about the SDK can be found here: http://www.tigerlogic.com/tigerlogic/omnis/products/components/buildyourown.jsp

Directories are setup relative and assume the framework is installed within the Omnis SDK folders:
- Omnis SDK
 - complib
 - omnis.xcomp.framework
 - ...

Dependencies
============
There are support libraries you need to download separately to compile these sources and I've added placeholders for these libraries in the source tree. 
So far this is limited to STB

License
=======
Please note that I'm releasing these works, including my own derivatives under an MIT license. In a nutshell this means you can use the code presented here as you see fit including in commercial projects. All I ask is that you give some credit to this body of work. See the license.txt file for the full license text.

I'm sure I'm stating the obvious that this license does not cover the SDK from Tigerlogic, only the code presented here.
