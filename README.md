Framework classes for building Omnis Studio XCOMPs

This is a framework I'm working on that combines a number of classes I've (re)written in various shapes and sizes as I've written Omnis Studio XComps over the years. I though it would be nice to donate these to the public domain. If you end up using any of this code feel free to drop me a line and a notice of sorts would be appreciated.

Current versions are all based on the Omnis Studio 6 unicode SDK but for as long as it makes sense I will include Studio 4 non-unicode project files. In due course non-unicode support will not be guaranteed.
These project files can be found in the example library. In due time I plan to compile the main framework into a library that can be linked into any projects that need it.

More information about the SDK can be found here: http://www.tigerlogic.com/tigerlogic/omnis/products/components/buildyourown.jsp

Directories are setup relative and assume the framework is installed within the Omnis SDK folders:
- Omnis SDK
 - complib
 - omnis.xcomp.framework
 - ...

I'm sure I'm stating the obvious that this license does not cover the SDK from Tigerlogic, only the code presented here.
